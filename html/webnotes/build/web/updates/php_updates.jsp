                            very summer we hold our annual conference dedicated to CakePHP. For the past 11 years, the framework has been a benchmark for PHP development, providing developers with a full stack MVC solution to build powerful applications which scale. This, coupled with an amazing community backing and thousands of plugins, makes CakePHP the number one choice for those who love code.
