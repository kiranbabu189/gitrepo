                            ASP.NET Core is a modern web development framework. Features such as model binding make your life easy by mapping form field values with model properties. So, accessing form and query string values manually might not be needed so often. However, at times you may need to read the form collection and query string values manually. The same can be said about Items collection of HttpContent. This article discusses how the form collection, query string values and Items collection can be accessed in ASP.NET

                            Microsoft released an out-of-band security update Thursday to address a critical Denial of Service vulnerability in ASP.NET.

The attack was exposed last Wednesday at a security conference, whereby a hash collision attack was used against several web framework servers, including PHP and ASP.NET.

“Hash collision attacks attempt to populate a hash-table within a server app with large numbers of items whose keys resolve to the same hash code” writes Microsoft’s Scott Guthrie in announcing the patch. “These key collisions can significantly slow down operations on the hash-table, and with enough elements can cause a server to spend minutes (or even hours) processing them.”

                            Microsoft has released an update to its Robotics Developer Studio 4 Beta, and among a fair few new features to the system since the last Beta in September, it includes support for the brand new Kinect for Windows SDK.

                            Microsoft isn’t exactly known for its watertight ship when it comes to keeping all its secrets, well, secret. Its favourite go-to for “leaking” information that it doesn’t want to announce but wants to be out there anyway, ZDNet’s Mary-Jo Foley, has an interesting titbit from the Azure team.

                            Windows Azure has been around for a while now and companies are getting used to the idea of migrating data services to “the cloud”. But what about high performance computing?

Scientists working with big data are often working in tools and platforms which don’t necessarily scale to cloud-based services by design, for example MATLAB (an analytical, engineering and computation tool). However, these tools provide a necessary framework for scientific computing which enables scientists to work more easily with their code – something .NET for example isn’t designed to provide.
